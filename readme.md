The fish identification project utilizes AI-based image recognition techniques to develop an accurate and user friendly web application. 
Using Streamlit, the application allows users to upload fish images and instantly identify the species found in the Indian Ocean, contributing to marine ecology and fisheries management. The
project combines transfer learning, deep learning algorithms, and user-centered design principles for efficient
and reliable fish species identification
